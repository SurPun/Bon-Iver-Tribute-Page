          >Bon Iver: For Emma, Forever Ago</a
        >
        is an album that will tear you down and build you back up. It is an
        emotional rollercoaster with some songs having gentle lyrics that you
        quite make out and other songs have lyrics that take the center stage
        all the while being accompanied by a classical folk guitar.

        This slowly starts to build up when the most relatable human feelings
        that everybody has felt at least once in their life (lonelines). This is
        the overwhelming feeling of lonelines in a search for meaning. Each song
        has it's own way of going about this and is through every strum in every
        falsetto, an image gracefully paints itself inside your mind.

        This album was a debut for a relatively unkown folk singer by the name
        of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Vernon" target="blank"
          >Justin Vernon</a
        >
        going by the name Bon Iver, originally released in 2007, it was later
        given a broader release in 2008. The story behind what led up to the
        creation of this album is very important. Stepping away from life can be
        difficult and Justin himself talks about what led to him retreating
        home.

        When Justin decided to head back home, all he had packed with him were
        some essentials, an old guitar and some recording equipment. The drive
        to do something with music was there but any intentions of making
        something like an album was almost non existent. At the time Justin
        traveled 18 hours across the country by himself, this long and lonely
        journey ended with him stopping at his parents house to only find that
        they were away. It was at this point the emptiness was beyond
        immeasurable and it was from there that he went on his way to the old
        hunting cabin his dad owned that he described as "a little alphine style
        timber-frame cabin". This cabin that he stayed in as Justin would put it
        was anything but magical. 
   
     </p>

     <p><em><b>"It's sort of odd to look back and see it as magical because it felt like a lonely few months at the cabin where i plugged in the laptop and messed around"</b></em>
    </p>

      <p id="p2">
        After spending some time in the cabin, an old laptop that Justin used for recording music crashed and erased dozens of unfinished songs. A lot of people in this soul-crushing situation might have given up on music forever but Justin saw an opportunity to change himself after burying it in the snow. An act that also held with its symbolism of burying himself the writing style that he's become accustomed to would change dramatically. A quote from Narayana Murthy is one that's very applicable here for Justin.

      Justin's life up until now was rough, his emotions have been building up for months. These are the emtions that were looked into for the creation of the album For Emma, Forever Ago. Each and every song that makes up this album has its own reasoning for being created. This is where every listener gets their own experience, these songs are'nt the greatest songs ever written but the soundscape that forms each and every track allows people to put themselves in the mindset that justin was in. At the time the way the album was made is actually quite intresting in and of itself. Instead of approaching each song with lyrics or a combination of music and lyrics, the sound itself was the main focus. This intresting way of approaching the album might have been what brought it to life.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
      Each and every song allows everybody to have the freedom to relate to what they're hearing in their own personal way. The album itself is believed to be named after a girl but there is no greater quote than the one Justin Vernon gave.
</br>
</br>
  "Emma isn't a person. Emma is a place that you get stuck in. Emma's a pain that you can't erase."
</br>
</br>
This quote perfectly describes this album better than anything because it opens it up for everyone without a strict reference or meaning behind everything, only the emotions intended to be felt will be felt. Nobody is wrong in interpreting this album and being able to relate to the music allows you to understand the beauty and pain in isolation.

  For Emma, Forever Ago is an album that should be listened to without the intentiion to focus on what's actually being said. It's an experience and it's one that has touched a lot of people.

     <p id="p3"><em>Hopeful</em>
         is the first emotion that comes to mind when i hear the song
        regarding
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9E2E8_Fhto" target="_blank"
          >Re-Stacks</a
        >
        by Bon Iver. That's not a coincidence, this song is the most hopeful
        song in the album. It is also the last song to the album which
        represents moving on but not forgetting the past.
